    "This project is part of the 2024 OSU Quantathon, where I took on the role of a commodities analyst at Buckeye Capital, a leading investment firm. My task was to analyze the markets, specifically focusing on crude oil (WTI Crude) and Delta Airlines (DAL) stock prices, to devise lucrative trading strategies. With an initial capital of $10,000, the challenge was to maximize returns through strategic investments in these assets.",
